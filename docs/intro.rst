About the app
=============

A normal web app with feature of social interaction requires to keep their users updated about recent happenings. For this, a notification system comes handy which stores numerous kinds of notifications and updates the user that a notification is received as soon as an action is performed.

The sole purpose of ``django-super-notifications`` is to add a *facebook-like* notification system functionality and give you the ability to control everything.

**The key features of Django Notify are**:

    - Send notifications to multiple user at once.
    - AJAX supported views to update, read and delete notifications on the client-side.
    - To provide activity-stream like field options.
    - To distinguish notifications by their types, so that you can control their behaviours easily.
    - To handle client-side javascript, the django way.
    - And many more!

Disclaimer
==========

This project may seem like a replica of `django-notifications`_ , yes, this project was highly inspired from ``django-notifications``.

But to make it clear, when I started this, too many features were already commited on the project and they used different approach from what I wanted. So instead of forking, doing too many changes and sending a PR, I started my own version of it :).
